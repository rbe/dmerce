dmerce 3:

  - magic-Vars
  - Logger in all classes/methods
  - dictionaries: keys are case-insensitive

dmerce 2.3.0:

 - (sql) soll erkennen schema.tabelle.feld...............ERL.
   - regexp anpassen
   - makro muss erkennen ob 2 oder 3 werte von der
     regexp zurueckkommen

 - dmerce_sys.Templates..................................ERL.
   - add field "Client": 0 / 1
   - DTL.Template

 - Login: Tables/Trigger:
   - add field "ClientGroup" that indicates wheter the
     user is in a clientgroup and which one or not

 - SQL-Layer/Oracle:
   - which tables/fields can be accessed how by user/role
   - when selecting, inserting, updateing or deleteing we verify
     that the user/role is granted to do that manipulation

     SELECT: when select is not granted to user/role -> table/field
             the result is empty

     INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE: when this operations are not permitted
             to user/role -> table/field we silently ignore this

     algorithm: check which table(s)/field(s) are permitted to select,
                insert, update or delete and manipulate query before
                execution (DTL.Operator.SQL)

     DTL.Operator.SQL:

     - do not raise exceptions, first check permissions for all table(s)/field(s)
       in query and remove unpermitted

   - UXS should only be used to decide/protect which 
      - templates
      - triggers
     can be accessed by groups/users. only dmerce functions sould be
     protected by UXS, not database objects
