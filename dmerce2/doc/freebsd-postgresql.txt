The PostgreSQL port has a collection of "side orders":

postgresql-doc
  For all of the html documentation

p5-Pg
  A perl5 API for client access to PostgreSQL databases.

postgresql-tcltk 
  If you want tcl/tk client support. You get a neat GUI, pgaccess, as
  a bonus!

postgresql-jdbc
  For Java JDBC support.

postgresql-odbc
  For client access from unix applications using ODBC as access
  method. Not needed to access unix PostgreSQL servers from Win32
  using ODBC. See below.

ruby-postgres, py-PyGreSQL
  For client access to PostgreSQL databases using the ruby & python
  languages.

p5-postgresql-plperl, postgresql-pltcl & postgresql-plruby
  For using perl5, tcl & ruby as procedural languages.

etc etc...

Note that many files have moved around compared to previous versions
of PostgreSQL. For example, plpgsql.so and all other language modules
are now in /usr/local/lib/postgresql.

If you have many tables and many clients running, consider raising
kern.maxfiles using sysctl(8), or reconfigure your kernel
appropriately.

You should vacuum and backup your database regularly. There is a
periodic script, /usr/local/share/postgresql/502.pgsql, that you may
find useful.

To allow many simultaneous connections to your PostgreSQL server, you
should raise the SystemV shared memory limits in your kernel. Here are
example values for allowing up to 180 clients (tinkering in
postgresql.conf also needed, of course):
  options         SYSVSHM
  options         SYSVSEM
  options         SYSVMSG
  options         SHMMAXPGS=65536
  options         SEMMNI=40
  options         SEMMNS=240
  options         SEMUME=40
  options         SEMMNU=120

If you plan to access your PostgreSQL server using ODBC, please
consider running the SQL script /usr/local/share/postgresql/odbc.sql
to get the functions required for ODBC compliance.

      * IMPORTANT UPGRADE NOTICE * IMPORTANT UPGRADE NOTICE *

The PostgreSQL port now obeys hier(7) by default, which means that it
installs into:

/usr/local/bin
/usr/local/lib
/usr/local/include  (NOTE! Changed again in 7.2, since PostgreSQL
                           handles standard install nowadays)

You *must* move away your pre-7.1 installation from users' and
ldconfig(8)'s PATHs.

The pgsql user's home dir is /usr/local/pgsql by default, but can be
changed with for example chpass(1). Datadir defaults to ~pgsql/data,
but can be changed by modifying the ~pgsql/.profile script.

======================================================================

To initialize the database, you should run initdb as the "pgsql" user
(if you want to use your locale for collation, edit ~pgsql/.profile
and set the locale to your preference first).

Example:

  su -l pgsql -c initdb

You can then start PostgreSQL by running:

  /usr/local/etc/rc.d/010.pgsql.sh start

For postmaster settings, see ~pgsql/data/postgresql.conf
For more tips, read ~pgsql/post-install-notes

===>  SECURITY REPORT: 
      This port has installed the following files which may act as network
      servers and may therefore pose a remote security risk to the system.
/usr/local/bin/ecpg
/usr/local/bin/pg_controldata
/usr/local/bin/pg_dump
/usr/local/bin/pg_dumpall
/usr/local/bin/pg_encoding
/usr/local/bin/pg_id
/usr/local/bin/pg_resetxlog
/usr/local/bin/pg_restore
/usr/local/bin/postgres
/usr/local/bin/psql

      This port has installed the following startup scripts which may cause
      these network services to be started at boot time.
/usr/local/etc/rc.d/010.pgsql.sh

      If there are vulnerabilities in these programs there may be a security
      risk to the system. FreeBSD makes no guarantee about the security of
      ports included in the Ports Collection. Please type 'make deinstall'
      to deinstall the port if this is a concern.
